//           MongoDB is quickly becoming one of the most popular databases in the
//           world. It is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data
//           in documents, rather than in tables like traditional databases. This
//           makes it an ideal choice for applications that require flexibility and
//           scalability. MongoDB is an ideal choice for applications that require
//           fast read and write performance. MongoDB can handle high volumes of
//           data and can scale up easily. With various techniques, you can scale
//           and optimize MongoDB performance. MongoDB also offers built-in
//           replication and sharding, which makes it easy to scale horizontally.
//           This ensures that the system remains highly available, even in the
//           face of failure. It offers a wide range of features and tools that
//           make it easy to work with the database. It has a flexible data model,
//           which makes it easier to create and modify documents. It also has
//           powerful query language that allows developers to quickly query and
//           manipulate documents. In addition to these features, MongoDB is
//           open-source. This means that developers can access the source code,
//           and modify it to meet their needs. This also makes it easy to find
//           help and resources online.
